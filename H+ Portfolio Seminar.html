   Course Description
  </h3>
  <p>
   This is a semester-long seminar for students completing the Humanities Plus program. Insofar as it intends to create a sensible, concise story about one's entire educational experience and to support that story with evidence, it is a humanities course. The resulting products should prove useful in preparing students for the modern job market, but the course is intended as a communal reflection on the very old-fashioned act of disciplining one's mind within classical disciplines.
  </p>
  <p>
    Scholars and students in the humanities too often think about our disciplines as content-based rather than skills-based, imagining their value in what we <i>known</i> rather than in what we <i>know how to do</i>. It is, therefore, worth taking a moment at the end of the program to reflect on what we have learned to do from our diverse disciplines and how those skills might prove valuable in the future. Often it is easier to see others' skills than our own, and so this seminar is intended to provide the intellectual community in which students will craft their own creative, true stories about the skills&mdash;both "soft" and "hard"&mdash;that they have developed while helping their classmates' to do the same self reflection. The final project will take the form of whatever portfolio/repository will best display what the student has done and can do in the future, but they should effectively demonstrate to broad audiences both the humanistic and the technological significance of that work.
  </p>
  <p>
   Final assessment in the course will be based on the portfolio itself and on a final, oral examination by a small committee of technologists and humanists.</p>
  <h3>
   Course Goals
  </h3>
  <h3>
   A successful student in this course will:
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Learn how to separate and describe discrete skills from the contexts in which they were developed.
   </li>
   <li>
    Provide a necessary and sufficient description of the context in which those skills were developed as a means toward their ends.
   </li>
    <li>
      Identify and describe relevant "soft" skills inculcated by the humanities, but also to interrogate the ostensible categories of "hard" and "soft".
    </li>
    <li>
      Learn to curate a portfolio or repository of previous work that tells a story.
    </li>
    <li>
      Develop the ability to explain and to defend one's ideas and work in doubly esoteric projects to broad audiences through oral communication.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
   <li>
    Participation:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Participate regularly and thoughtfully during in-class discussion.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Project Proposal with data:
    <ul>
     <li>
      A brief proposal (~1000 words) for a research project.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   Identify the research project, concisely and argumentatively identifying the current state of the traditional scholarly literature on the topic, including whether any of that work has been done computationally.
   <li>
    Identify specific dataset(s) and how they relate to this research project, including what new information and errors this data will introduce.
   </li>
   <li>
    Research Question and Methods Proposal
    <ul>
     <li>
      An additional 1,000-word section added to a revised proposal from the previous assignment.
     </li>
     <li>
      This section should explaining the research questions you will attempt to answer and the methods of analysis you propose to use to do that.
     </li>
     <li>
      Pay particular attention to the apporopriateness of your methods to your data.
     </li>
     <li>
      Also ensure that you address what these methods can and cannot reveal (and what they might actively obscure) when used on this data, for these purposes.
     </li>
     <li>
      You should make sure to revise your previous work, too, since your methodological choices, new knowledge, and deeper reflection will change the project you want to pursue, which data you use, how you might use it, and what problems and advantages it will hold for this project.

      This must include revised versions of the previous sections as well as a deeper literature review from the side of the humanities and a careful reflection on the methodology citing examples of other similar uses of these methods.

  <h3>
   Academic Integrity
  </h3>
  <p>
   George Fox University takes plagiarism as a breach of academic integrity very seriously. Plagiarism includes not only quoting without attribute, but also writing in a way that follows too closely the ideas or logic of another source. The best way to avoid plagiarism is simply to make your own argument in your own voice and to support that argument with direct quotations and paraphrases which are clearly cited. Please cite your sources using footnotes according to the Chicago Manual of Style. You might find it useful to use a citation manager like Zotero, though you should know how to write footnotes on your own and should always check the accuracy of any notes in anything you write.
  </p>
