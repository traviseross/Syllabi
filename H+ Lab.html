   </li>
   <li>
    Project Proposal with data:
    <ul>
     <li>
      A brief proposal (~1000 words) for a research project.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   Identify the research project, concisely and argumentatively identifying the current state of the traditional scholarly literature on the topic, including whether any of that work has been done computationally.
   <li>
    Identify specific dataset(s) and how they relate to this research project, including what new information and errors this data will introduce.
   </li>
   <li>
    Research Question and Methods Proposal
    <ul>
     <li>
      An additional 1,000-word section added to a revised proposal from the previous assignment.
     </li>
     <li>
      This section should explaining the research questions you will attempt to answer and the methods of analysis you propose to use to do that.
     </li>
     <li>
      Pay particular attention to the apporopriateness of your methods to your data.
     </li>
     <li>
      Also ensure that you address what these methods can and cannot reveal (and what they might actively obscure) when used on this data, for these purposes.
     </li>
     <li>

  <h3>
   Academic Integrity
  </h3>
  <p>
   George Fox University takes plagiarism as a breach of academic integrity very seriously. Plagiarism includes not only quoting without attribute, but also writing in a way that follows too closely the ideas or logic of another source. The best way to avoid plagiarism is simply to make your own argument in your own voice and to support that argument with direct quotations and paraphrases which are clearly cited. Please cite your sources using footnotes according to the Chicago Manual of Style. You might find it useful to use a citation manager like Zotero, though you should know how to write footnotes on your own and should always check the accuracy of any notes in anything you write.
  </p>
