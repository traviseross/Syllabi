<h3>Course Description&nbsp;</h3>
<div>
<p>This seminar will examine the history of book collecting in the United States with a special emphasis on the North American West. We will pay particular attention to the outsized role Yale's faculty, alumni, and institutions have played in producing the canon and great collections of western Americana. It will include several site visits to libraries and museums at Yale and around New England, including the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscripts Library, Yale Center for British Art, the Lewis Walpole Library, the American Antiquarian Society, and the John Carter Brown Library. We will also visit exemplary sites of exchange in the antiquarian book trade, including the New York Antiquarian Book Fair, the William Reese Company, Whitlock&rsquo;s Book Barn, and an auction at Swann&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>This course will have a regional focus on the North American West due in part to the instructor&rsquo;s expertise in that area, but also due to the significance of Yale&rsquo;s faculty, alumni, and institutions in the making of western Americana, an influence that has made New Haven, Connecticut an unexpected hub of the trade in western Americana for nearly a century.&nbsp;The centrality of westward expansion and its iconography to the formation of a dominant American identity has long placed western Americana at the fore of the trade in Americana of any type. In spite of that focus, students will be permitted to research any area or topic that they choose, though they will have to do more independent research depending on how far afield they choose to go.</p>
<p>As a seminar in book history, this course will examine the history of making, selling, buying, collecting, and reading printed objects in the United States. We will proceed through three units in roughly reverse chronological order. The first unit will examine with the cultural production of western Americana as a relatively finite number of collectible materials by the efforts of a small group of collectors and organizations whose own collections, bibliographies, and curated lists defined the field. The second unit will focus on the history of print&nbsp;<i>in </i>the American West while the third unit will examine the history of making books <i>about </i>that region, its exploration and settlement. Throughout, we will link the inspection of the materials objects to the technologies of production by which books and other printed objects have been made since about 1790.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Roles &amp; Goals</strong></p>
<p>Students will learn to inhabit the following roles:</p>
<p><i>Role:</i> A strategic learner who directs her or his own educational experience in a seminar.<br /><i>Goal:</i> You should become an independent, resilient, and flexible student capable or creating the conditions to succeed in a Yale College seminar and to respond effectively to constructive criticism.</p>
<p><i>Role:</i> A thoughtful interlocutor capable of exchanging complex information with scholars and professionals in conversation.<br /><i>Goal:</i> You should learn how to ask good questions, how to listen carefully, how to respond thoughtfully, and how to incorporate new information going forward.</p>
<p><i>Role:</i> An expert on a narrow topic related to the history of the book in America.<br /><i>Goal:</i>You should become confident and comfortable with what you know, with what you do not yet know, how to tell the difference, and how to respond effectively whether you are right or wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Outcomes</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students who successfully complete this course will be able to:</p>
<ul>

<h3>Assignments</h3>
<h4><strong>Prospectus for a List (3-4 pages, 15% of final grade)&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<div style="padding-left: 50px;">
<p>Your prospectus should outline the proposed area in which you will create your list. Perhaps your collection will focus on books about a group of people, a place, or theme. Perhaps you want to collect materials written about or printed/published <i>in </i>a particular place. Think about the variety of collections and bibliographies we have examined in this class and those listed in the course resources, noting how different motivating questions and collecting strategies behind them produced very different results.&nbsp;</p>
Your prospectus should answer the following questions:
<ol>
<li>&ldquo;What do I want this collection to illustrate about the topic I have chosen?&rdquo;
<p>Keep in mind that you need not collect the actual objects of interest. For instance, a collection related to <em>Uncle Tom's Cabin</em> and its significance to the outbreak of the Civil War could take the form of representative copies of the various editions of that book published around the world or published and unpublished sources related to its production, sale, and reception, including book reviews, editorials, and catalogs. While ostensibly about the same topic, those different collections would look very different in terms of scope and price, but would also illustrate rather different things about the history in question.</p>
</li>
<li>What do I value in a potential acquisition?
<p>What will you value in a potential acquisition&mdash;edition, quality of the copy, a particular association or provenance&mdash;and why are those values important to your collecting goals? What kinds of things have you devalued and why?</p>
</li>
<li>How will you decide whether a potential acquisition <em>fits</em> within your collection and whether?
<p>Collecting requires one to make hard decisions. Most obviously, there will be items that would fit your collection that you will have to forego because they are not likely to come up for sale or would be prohibitively expensive if they did. Less obviously, though, you might also decide not to acquire otherwise wonderful works that you encounter because they would begin distract from the logic of an otherwise coherent collection. While you might &ldquo;know it when you see it,&rdquo; think carefully about how you expect to know it and what you expect you will be looking to see when you do.</p>
</li>
<li>How will this collection relate to existing bibliographic work in the field and to aligned collections, whether privately or institutionally held?
<p>No work of scholarship breaks entirely new ground, and so all scholars have to build their work on and place it in relation to the work others have already done. Begin by perusing the resources available here on Canvas. Visit the Beinecke Library or another appropriate library and talk to a librarian or curator and use their reference materials. You will obviously use the online library catalogs and internet searches, but you will save yourself a lot of time&mdash;in this and all subsequent research projects&mdash;if you talk to a librarian long before the due date for a project and let that conversation guide your research.</p>
</li>
<li>How difficult do you expect it to be to find these materials?
<p>Be sure to note how anticipated price, availability, or other factors have already caused you to redirect your proposed collection from what you might have included in a comprehensive bibliography on your initial topic of interest. Do you expect to have to leave conspicuous holes in your collection for some reason?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Learning objectives:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You will learn how to begin a research project from scratch, using all of the resources available to you through the Yale Library system, but especially subject matter experts, curators, reference materials, finding aids, and the catalog.</li>
<li>You will practice writing in an academic voice, avoiding contractions, passive voice, clich&Atilde;&copy;s and colloquialisms while using evidence from <em>appropriate</em> sources to carefully support your claims.</li>
<li>You will learn to format an academic paper using the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>, properly citing all information that you have incorporated through paraphrases and direct quotations.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h4><strong>Preliminary List (8-10 pages, 20% of final grade)</strong></h4>
<div style="padding-left: 50px;">
<p>This preliminary list should begin with a revised and refined version of your prospectus, which you should revise both in response to my comments and to the new information you have discovered in your ongoing research. Please note that that might include expanding in some areas while cutting in others, as there will almost certainly turn out to be sections of your prospectus that you needed to write in order to learn something but that your readers will not need to read in order to know what you now know. Revising is not the same as editing. While you must fix the issues that I have flagged in your prospectus, you must make substantive changes to your work, too. Your project will necessitate changes, too. For instance, if you have realized that your collection will include distinct subcategories, you should explain those divisions in this new introduction.</p>
<p>You must then include an annotated &ldquo;want list&rdquo; that will begin to show what works (or <em>types</em> of works) will comprise your collection. Your want list might include specific titles as well as types of materials you expect to collect, but those inclusions ought to be based on real or expected availability, with the latter based on what similar titles have sold for in the past (and how often) as listed in <a href="https://www.bookpricescurrent.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Book Prices Current</a> or back issues of bookseller&rsquo;s catalogs. You should begin to identify how you might subdivide your list, if necessary. Entries should be formatted as bibliographic entries according to the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em> and roughly in the format exemplified in the exhibit catalogs or bookseller&rsquo;s catalogs we have looked at.</p>
<p><strong>Learning objectives:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You will learn how to make significant revisions to an ongoing project both in response to an instructor&rsquo;s feedback and as a result of learning more information.</li>
<li>You will begin to make difficult choices about what you can and cannot hope to include in your collection, and will continue refining your critical thinking about the decisions you are making throughout this process.</li>
<li>You will learn to format an annotated bibliography using the <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>, but you will also learn the important skill of adapting the general rules and principles in that style guide to fit the necessities of your current task.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h4><strong>Response to a Classmate&rsquo;s Preliminary List (2 pages, 10% of final grade)</strong></h4>
<div style="padding-left: 50px;">
<p>Each student will respond to the preliminary list compiled by one of her or his classmates. Responses should aim to be critical yet generous, aiming to identify real problems or oversights while offering meaningful suggestions about how to address them.</p>
</div>
<h4><strong>Final Project and Presentation (35% of final grade)</strong></h4>
<div style="padding-left: 50px;">
<p>This final product will vary significantly based on the choices you made earlier in the semester, but it should outline a collection&mdash;probably hypothetical, but perhaps with some real first fruits&mdash;while critically analyzing the assumptions, values, expectations, and blindspots that guided you to build this collection.</p>
</div>
<h4><strong>Participation (20% of final grade)</strong></h4>
<h4><em>*Late Assignment Policy</em></h4>
<div>
<div>All work submitted after the stated deadline will be assessed a 1/3 letter grade penalty per day. Late work may be excused from this penalty <i>at the instructor&rsquo;s discretion </i>pursuant to a formal request sent via email.</div>
</div>
<h3>Diversity &amp;Inclusion Policies</h3>
<div>
<p>The instructor and students in this course will create and actively defend an inclusive learning space. Students can expect to engage in honest, critical discussion of important, sometimes contentious topics but will be expected to remain civil, to be conscious of microaggressions, and to interrogate implicit biases.</p>
<p>Commitment to an inclusive learning environment: Yale University adheres to the philosophy that all community members should enjoy an environment free of any form of harassment, sexual misconduct, discrimination, or intimate partner violence. If you have been the victim of sexual misconduct, we encourage you to report this. If you report this to a faculty/staff member, they must notify our college&rsquo;s Title IX coordinator about the basic facts of the incident (you may choose to request confidentiality from the University). If you encounter sexual harassment, sexual misconduct, sexual assault, or discrimination based on race, color, religion, age, national origin, ancestry, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability please contact the Title IX Coordinator, Stephanie Spangler, at <a href="mailto:stephanie.spangler@yale.edu">stephanie.spangler@yale.edu</a> (203.432.4446) or any of the University Title IX Coordinators, who can be found at: <a href="http://provost.yale.edu/title-ix/coordinators">http://provost.yale.edu/title-ix/coordinators</a>.</p>
<p>Your experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with the Resource Office on Disabilities, please communicate your approved accommodations to me at your earliest convenience so we can discuss your needs in this course. If you have not yet established services through ROD, but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability that requires accommodations (conditions include but are not limited to: mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health impacts), you are welcome to contact ROD at 203-432-2324 to make an appointment. General information for students can be found on the Student Information page of the Resource Office on Disabilities&ldquo; website. ROD offers resources and coordinates reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities and/or temporary health conditions. Reasonable accommodations are established through an interactive process between you, your instructor(s), and ROD. It is important to Yale University to create inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law.</p>
