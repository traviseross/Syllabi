   Course Description
  </h3>
  <p>
   An introductory theory and methods course for the Humanities Plus program. This course will introduce students to computational methods and the software tools used to implement them. It will also focus intensively on the theory and epistemological problems inherent in traditional and computer-aided humanistic research.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Course Goals
  </h3>
  <h3>
   A successful student in this course will learn:
  </h3>
  <ul>
   <li>
    Identify, access, and prepare data from public sources as well as create datasets from traditional sources in the humanities.
   </li>
   <li>
    Understand, manipulate, and transform standard data objects using appropriate software packages.
   </li>
   <li>
    Choose appropriate methods to analyze the data in order to answer questions.
   </li>
   <li>
    Describe the data, methods, and results both discursively and through clear, thoughtful graphical depictions.
   </li>
   <li>
    Integrate those methods into larger discipline-specific humanistic research, paying particular attention to the errors, biases, or gaps inherent in the data and/or introduced in the methods used to analyze them.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>
   Required Texts
  </h3>
  Required readings will be posted to Canvas.

   Assigments
  </h3>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Participation:
    <ul>
     <li>
      Participate regularly and thoughtfully during in-class discussion.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Project Proposal with data:
    <ul>
     <li>
      A brief proposal (~1000 words) for a research project.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   Identify the research project, concisely and argumentatively identifying the current state of the traditional scholarly literature on the topic, including whether any of that work has been done computationally.
   <li>
    Identify specific dataset(s) and how they relate to this research project, including what new information and errors this data will introduce.
   </li>
   <li>
    Research Question and Methods Proposal
    <ul>
     <li>
      An additional 1,000-word section added to a revised proposal from the previous assignment.
     </li>
     <li>
      This section should explaining the research questions you will attempt to answer and the methods of analysis you propose to use to do that.
     </li>
     <li>
      Pay particular attention to the apporopriateness of your methods to your data.
     </li>
     <li>
      Also ensure that you address what these methods can and cannot reveal (and what they might actively obscure) when used on this data, for these purposes.
     </li>
     <li>
      You should make sure to revise your previous work, too, since your methodological choices, new knowledge, and deeper reflection will change the project you want to pursue, which data you use, how you might use it, and what problems and advantages it will hold for this project.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Full Draft of Research Proposal:
    <ul>
     <li>
      A full, expanded and revised research proposal (~3000 words)
     </li>
     <li>
      This must include revised versions of the previous sections as well as a deeper literature review from the side of the humanities and a careful reflection on the methodology citing examples of other similar uses of these methods.
     </li>
    </ul>
   </li>
   <li>
    Peer review report: 10%
   </li>
   <ul>
    <li>
     A thoughtful, sensitive response to your classmate's project.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <li>
    Final Research Proposal: 25%
   </li>
   <ul>
    <li>
     A final, fully revised project proposal with preliminary analysis.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </ol>

  <h3>
   Academic Integrity
  </h3>
  <p>
   George Fox University takes plagiarism as a breach of academic integrity very seriously. Plagiarism includes not only quoting without attribute, but also writing in a way that follows too closely the ideas or logic of another source. The best way to avoid plagiarism is simply to make your own argument in your own voice and to support that argument with direct quotations and paraphrases which are clearly cited. Please cite your sources using footnotes according to the Chicago Manual of Style. You might find it useful to use a citation manager like Zotero, though you should know how to write footnotes on your own and should always check the accuracy of any notes in anything you write.
  </p>
  <h3>
   Diversity &amp; Inclusion Policies
  </h3>

   <p>
    If you have specific physical, psychiatric, or learning disabilities and require accommodations, please contact the Disability Services Office early in the term so that your learning needs may be appropriately met. You will need to provide current documentation of your disability to Disability Services. For more information, please contact the Director of Disability Services or go to
